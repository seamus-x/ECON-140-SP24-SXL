    "## Functions in `R`\n",
    "\n",
    "We have encountered quite a few functions in `R` that are useful in a wide range of different situations, eg. `for()`, `runif()`, and `lm()`. We have discussed during lecture that, with some exceptions (notably many arithmetic functions), functions in `R` typically takes on the form of a function name followed immediately by a set of parenthesis in which arguments are entered, *e.g.* `runif(100, -10, 10)` returns a vector 100 random numbers generated from a uniform distribution with support [-10, 10].\n",
    "\n",
    "To access a function from an installed package without loading the package into your R environment, you can call the funciton directly by using the `package_name::function_name()` construction. For example, in order to use the `read_dta()` function from the `haven` package, as you did from the previous problem set, you can simply type `haven::read_dta()` instead of first loading `haven` into the environment by executing `library(haven)`. This can be very useful when you only need a couple functions from a certain package, especially if loading such a package would mask other functions, meaning that the package contains functions with the same names as functions from base `R` or another package.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you can make your own custom functions by using the `function()` function. Custom functions are one of the most important, useful, and powerful tools of most programming languages, as it allows repeating complex operations with different inputs by shorthanding the operation into just one command. The basic syntax of making a custom function in `R` is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```R\n",
    "myfun <- function(arg1, arg2 = 0, ...){\n",
    "    result <- ...\n",
    "    return(result)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "where `myfun` is the name of the custom function, `arg1`, *etc.*, are the arguments that go into the function with any assigned value being the default (*e.g.* 0 being the default for `arg2`), and `result` being the value that is returned by the custom function. Consider the following example custom function that takes 3 arguments, `x`, `y`, and `z` with the default value of 1, and returns $(x+y)^z$:\n",
    "```R\n",
    "myfun <- function(x, y, z = 1){\n",
    "    result <- (x + y)^z\n",
    "    return(result)\n",
    "}\n",
    "myfun(1, 2) # (1 + 2)^1\n",

    "Now it's your turn to create a small program. For this program, you will need to run 1000 iterations of the same process, each would draw a random number from a normal distribution characterized by $N(0,1)$ until you draw a number that is more than 2 standard deviations from the mean, *ie.* greater than 2 or less than -2. For each iteration, record the number of draws until you get the greater than $2\\sigma$ draw. The only output of your program should consist of a single histogram that summarizes the 1000 numbers of draws from each iteration. Write the program in the code block below. *Hint* while there are many ways to write this program, the most efficient route does not make use of `if` statements."
